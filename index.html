        <h2>TPM Event Log 📃</h2>
      <p>
        Check what happened when your hardware platform started. What driver
        blobs were loaded? What were their hashes? Did they match the expected
        values? How many steps were there? Is bootloader or kernel integrity
        compromised? Can you trust your firmware?

        <h2>UEFI/PSP/ME Filesystem Exploration 🕵️</h2>
        <p>
          Look what drivers your OEM included, or tailor an image for your own
          or your client's specific use-case. See what can be removed, swap out
          the built-in boot mechanisms for
          <a href="https://linuxboot.org/">LinuxBoot</a>, and deploy a fully
          secure boot environment.

        <h2>Flash Usage Visualization</h2>
        <p>
          See how many blocks of your SPI flash are in use. What partitions or
          components occupy excess amounts of space? Is the storage used
          efficiently? Is there enough free space to add a new feature to the
          pre-OS environment?

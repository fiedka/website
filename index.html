        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware">firmware</a>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software">app</a>.
        It allows for exploration and inspection of, development for, auditing,
        and generally understanding hardware platforms. While targeting multiple
        processor architectures and SoCs from various vendors, the long term
        goal of the project is to fully resolve any possible opaqueness to the
        end user.

        <h2>UEFI/PSP/ME Filesystem Exploration 📁</h2>
        <p>
          Look what drivers your OEM included, or tailor an image for your own
          or your client's specific use-case. See what can be removed, swap out
          the built-in boot mechanisms for
          <a href="https://linuxboot.org/">LinuxBoot</a>, and deploy a fully
          secure boot environment.

        <h2>Flash Usage Visualization 📊</h2>
        <p>
          See how many blocks of your SPI flash are in use. What partitions or
          components occupy excess amounts of space? Is the storage used
          efficiently? Is there enough free space to add a new feature to the
          pre-OS environment?

        <h2>TPM Event Log 📃</h2>
      <p>
        Check what happened when your hardware platform started. What driver
        blobs were loaded? What were their hashes? Did they match the expected
        values? How many steps were there? Is bootloader or kernel integrity
        compromised? Can you trust your firmware?

        <h2>Investigate Platform State 🕵️</h2>
      <p>
        See what NVRAM is used for, what EFI variables are defined and what they
        contain. Edit them easily, see which ones are critical for booting the
        platform, and what may be removed.
